# python
this repository shows all the exercises/mini-projects I have previously finished using python to better understand the language;

these files are not a representations of my current level of fluency, if you look at my most recent projects in my profile you will get a better sense of my knowledge/abilities;

feel free to contact me with questions or comments;
